# PDDLGym: PDDL &rarr; OpenAI Gym

![Sokoban example](images/sokoban_example.gif?raw=true "Sokoban example")

**This library is under development by [Tom Silver](http://web.mit.edu/tslvr/www/) and [Rohan Chitnis](https://rohanchitnis.com/).**

## Paper

Please see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06432) describing the design decisions and implementation details behind PDDLGym.

## Status

**The following PDDL features are not yet supported:**
- Hierarchical types (blocked by: parsing)
- Equality (blocked by: parsing and inference)
- Quantifiers (forall, exists) and disjunctions (ors) (blocked by: inference)

Several PDDL environments are included, including
- Sokoban
- Depot
- Blocks
- Keys and Doors
- Towers of Hanoi
- "Minecraft"
- "Rearrangement"
- "Travel"
- "Baking"

(Environments in quotes indicate ones that we made up ourselves. Unquoted environments are standard ones whose PDDL files are available online, with light modifications to support our interface.)

## Installation

First, set up a virtual environment with Python 3. For instance, if you use [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can simply run `mkvirtualenv --python=<path to Python 3> pddlgymenv`. Next, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. Now you should able to run the random agent demos in `demo.py`.

### (Optional) Planner Dependencies
To be able to run the planning demos in `demo.py`, install [Fast-Forward](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html). Set environment variable `FF_PATH` to the `ff` executable, wherever you install it.

## Usage examples

### Hello, PDDLGym
```
import gym
import pddlgym
import imageio

env = gym.make("PDDLEnvSokoban-v0")
obs, debug_info = env.reset()
action = env.action_space.sample()
obs, reward, done, debug_info = env.step(action)
img = env.render()
imageio.imsave("frame1.png", img)
```

### Plan with FastForward
```
from utils import run_planning_demo

import gym
import pddlgym

# See `pddl/sokoban.pddl` and `pddl/sokoban/problem3.pddl`.
env = gym.make("PDDLEnvSokoban-v0")
env.fix_problem_index(2)
run_planning_demo(env, 'ff', verbose=True)
```

## Adding a new domain

### Step 1: Adding PDDL files
Create a domain PDDL file and one or more problem PDDL files. (See important notes below.) Put the domain file in `pddl/` and the problem files in `pddl/<domain name>`. Make sure that the name of your new domain is consistent and is used for the domain pddl filename and the problem directory.

**Note 1:** Only a certain subset of PDDL is supported right now -- see "Status" above.

**Note 2:** PDDLGym requires that certain predicates are special "predicate actions". For example, in Sokoban, we add a `(Move ?dir - direction)` predicate. Action predicates must be incorporated in four places:
1. Alongside the typical predicate declarations in the domain file.
2. In a space-separated list of format `; (:actions <action predicate name 1> <action predicate name 2> ...)` in the domain file. (Note the semicolon at the beginning!)
3. One variable-grounded action predicate should appear in the preconditions of every operator in the domain file.
4. In each problem file, all possible ground actions should be listed alongside the other :init declarations.
See `pddl/sokoban.pddl` and `pddl/sokoban/problem1.pddl` for an example to follow.

The rationale for distinguishing actions from operators is related to the boundary between agent and environment. This project views PDDL operators as collectively implementing a transition model, which is part of the environment and unknown to the agent. Actions are the things passed from the agent to the environment, like motor commands on a robot. Operators describe the environmental consequences of the agent's actions. For instance, a `moveto` command may only be parameterized by a target pose from the perspective of the agent, but internally to the environment, it must also be parameterized by the current pose because a literal must be created specifying that the agent is no longer at this current pose.

### Step 2 (optional): Implement rendering
* Implement a render function in a new file in `rendering/`. For example, in `rendering/rearrangement.py`, implement `render(obs, *args, **kwargs)`, where `obs` is a set of literals. Update `rendering/__init__.py` to import your new function.

### Step 3: Register Gym environment
* Update `__init__.py` to register your new environment. For example, `register_pddl_env("rearrangement", rearrangement_render)`.
